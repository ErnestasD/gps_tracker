# TrackCore

Multi-tenant, white-label GPS tracking platform for Teltonika devices.
Normative spec: [PROJECT_PLAN.md](PROJECT_PLAN.md) · backlog: [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) · operating rules: [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Setup

```sh
nvm use            # Node 22 (.nvmrc)
npm i -g pnpm@10   # once per machine (corepack currently broken with pnpm 10+)
pnpm install       # also auto-installs git hooks (prepare -> core.hooksPath)
```

## Development

```sh
pnpm turbo run typecheck lint test   # all quality gates (alias: make gates)
pnpm turbo run dev --filter=<app>    # once apps have dev servers
```

The pre-commit hook re-runs the gates for staged packages and their dependents
(turbo cache makes this near-instant when they already passed). Commits touching
`packages/codec/__fixtures__` additionally require a `FIXTURE-APPROVED:` trailer
in the commit message, and any staged `TODO(VERIFY-WIKI)` marker blocks the commit
(see CLAUDE.md rules 8–9).

## Monorepo

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `apps/ingest` | raw TCP ingest: framing, handshake, CRC, parse, XADD, ACK — zero business logic |
| `apps/worker` | stream consumers (ordered pipeline) + BullMQ jobs |
| `apps/api` | Hono REST + WS gateway |
| `apps/web` | React SPA (Vite, MapLibre, TanStack, shadcn) |
| `packages/codec` | Teltonika parser wrapper + AVL dictionaries + golden fixtures |
| `packages/db` | Prisma (relational) + raw SQL layer for positions + scoped repositories |
| `packages/shared` | zod schemas — single source of types |
| `tools/simulator` | device emulator (scenarios per PROJECT_PLAN §7.2) |
| `tools/replay` | real-log replayer for load tests |
| `tools/redact` | strips real IMEIs from captures before they become fixtures |

## Environment variables

None yet. Every new variable must be added to the table here AND `.env` contract
